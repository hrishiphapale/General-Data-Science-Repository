# Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!

This repository serves as a showcase of my data science journey, encompassing a diverse range of projects, code snippets, and learnings. Here, you'll find explorations in:

Data Analysis: Techniques for data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering.
Machine Learning: Implementations of various machine learning algorithms, including supervised (classification, regression), unsupervised (clustering), and reinforcement learning.
Deep Learning: Deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and other deep learning architectures1 for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.



### Key Projects:
Coming Soon

### Basic Projects:
  Linear Regression 
  Logistic Regresstion


While this repository primarily focuses on showcasing my work, contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, experiment with the code, and share your own insights.
