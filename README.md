# Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!

This repository serves as a showcase of my data science journey, encompassing a diverse range of projects, code snippets, and learnings. Here, you'll find explorations in:

Data Analysis: Techniques for data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering.
Machine Learning: Implementations of various machine learning algorithms, including supervised (classification, regression), unsupervised (clustering), and reinforcement learning.
Deep Learning: Deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and other deep learning architectures1 for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.
